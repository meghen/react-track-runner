# Track Runner App
## Description
Duration:  1 hour

A distance runner wants to keep track of their recent miles ran as well as their longest miles ran. This app is made to take in their miles after a run and check if that run was longer than their previous record. If so, it updates the longest run value.

### Technologies Used
- React

## Checklist
- [x] Create an application that allows the user to enter their most recent run. It should always update the most recent section, but if it's the longest run, it should also update that section as well.

## Stretch Goals
- [ ]  Add another section for her fastest run that displays the fastest run based on miles per hour.
